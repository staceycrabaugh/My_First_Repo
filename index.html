            <p>My name is Stacey Crabaugh and I'm an experiential designer based in Portland, Oregon. I have spent over 15 years designing spaces for retail, trade show environments, marketing events and virtual experiences. Most recently I was a senior experiential designer at Pinnacle where I worked with brands such as Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., Microsoft, Magic: The Gathering, Brooks Running and Leatherman.
            </p>
            <p>I love working in partnership with diverse teams to help realize and validate ideas. My approach involves building a design strategy based on brand and user research. Creating spaces big and small, virtual and real life, with a goal of great user experiences is the kind of work I'm looking for.
